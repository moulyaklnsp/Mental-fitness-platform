            <h3>Our Journey</h3>
            <p>Eternal was born out of a shared passion for promoting mental wellness in a world that often overlooks its importance. Our founders, a group of dedicated mental health professionals and wellness advocates, experienced firsthand the transformative power of mental fitness.</p>
            <p>Each of us has faced challenges that tested our mental resilience. Through our experiences, we discovered the necessity of accessible mental fitness resources that empower individuals to cultivate their inner strength. With this vision in mind, we created Eternalâ€”a community where support, education, and personal growth converge.</p>
